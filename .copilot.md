do not 
do not say it is working while it is not , 
do not do simplifications of the code to get it running , be honoust and not so hyper optimisting .
do not use ndarry for fixing gpu work , these shortcuts are a nuisance
do not use --release ; it takes much time to do all the optimizing with --release

Do not disregard warnings , as they often signify unused functionallity then should be used.

report what is NOT working , that is more helpfull. Extra check the fake implementation , they are a nuisance

Burn, with his version the type Data has been replaced with TensorData.
Burm , thus also crate dlinoss, 
Check the burn crate examples and read the  (cook)books , it is very helpfull.

Check /home/rustuser/projects/active/LinossRust it has references to the Linoss and  D-Linoss papers; Especialy , check whether our math is correct implemented in the code,much is burn-tensor-calculations, that can run completely on a backend , prevetn unnessesary data-swaps between cpu and gpu , this does NOT mean that u can drop the gpu , this device should allways be used in tests and trials. , there are exceptions 

Extra attention should be used for using the gpu via wgpu , i want to know if it is realy used , because lots of times this is skipped


Do not use the words : ..,  better, professional, realy-realy-working , but-now-realy-realy-working ;; in filenames and rust idnetifyers . Use a short marker instead (like hh:mm 4 digits)


read this .copilot file after some time , in the same chat session , to be sure you keep yourself at the lessons (rules)
