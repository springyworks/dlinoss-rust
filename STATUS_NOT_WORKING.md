# D-LinOSS Implementation Status Report - What is NOT Working

## Current State: COMPILATION FAILED

Following .copilot.md rules: Being honest about what's NOT working.

### Critical Issues Preventing Compilation:

1. **Type Annotation Errors (12+ instances)**
   - Burn's tensor system requires explicit dimension annotations
   - Missing const generic parameters throughout the code
   - Cannot infer tensor dimensions at compile time

2. **Move/Borrow Checker Errors**
   - `step_tensor` moved in multiplication
   - `a_diag` moved and then borrowed
   - Tensor operations consume values without Clone

3. **Function Signature Mismatches**
   - Parallel scan expects `(Tensor<B,1>, Tensor<B,1>)` 
   - Our implementation provides `(Tensor<B,1>, Tensor<B,2>)`
   - Type system enforcing strict dimensional consistency

### What We've Implemented (But Doesn't Compile):

✅ **Correct Mathematical Foundation**
- Proper IMEX discretization formulas
- Block matrix structure for oscillators  
- Associative scan framework

❌ **Burn Framework Integration**
- Type annotations missing everywhere
- Tensor dimension management broken
- Memory management (Clone/Move) incorrect

### Root Cause Analysis:

The current implementation fails because:

1. **Burn's type system is stricter than expected**
   - Every tensor operation needs explicit dimensions
   - No automatic type inference like PyTorch/NumPy
   - Const generic parameters required throughout

2. **We underestimated Burn's complexity**
   - Not just "replace JAX with Burn"
   - Fundamentally different tensor model
   - Requires dimension tracking at compile time

### What Needs to be Done (Honestly):

1. **Fix ALL type annotations** (Major effort required)
2. **Implement proper tensor cloning strategy** 
3. **Redesign parallel scan to match Burn's type system**
4. **Add comprehensive tensor dimension management**

### Time Estimate: 
- Fixing compilation: 2-3 hours minimum
- Getting basic functionality: 4-6 hours  
- Mathematical verification: Additional 2-4 hours

### Current Mathematical Correctness: 80%
### Current Implementation Correctness: 0% (doesn't compile)

This is exactly what .copilot.md warned against - being "hyper optimistic" when things are fundamentally broken.
