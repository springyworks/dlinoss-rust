# D-LinOSS Test Suite

This directory contains the test suite for the D-LinOSS (Damped Linear Oscillatory State-Space) implementation.

## Test Files Overview

### `test_honest_1124.rs` - Honest Assessment Test Suite
**Primary Focus: Following .copilot guidelines for honest reporting**

This test suite explicitly documents what's **NOT working** rather than oversimplifying or claiming false success:

#### Issues Identified:
1. **❌ GPU Device Initialization Conflicts**
   - Multiple tests can't run together due to "Client already created for device DefaultDevice"
   - Tests must be run individually to avoid GPU backend conflicts

2. **❌ Sequential Implementation, Not Parallel Scan**
   - Current `apply_damped_linoss_imex` uses O(n*seq_len) sequential loop
   - Should be O(log(seq_len)) parallel scan using binary operator
   - No tree-based parallel reduction implemented

3. **❌ No Actual GPU Usage Verification**
   - Device info printing doesn't prove GPU computation
   - No memory usage monitoring or profiling tools
   - Cannot verify if operations actually run on GPU hardware

4. **❌ No Python Reference Comparison**
   - Missing 1-to-1 comparison with damped-linoss Python implementation
   - No numerical equivalence verification
   - No deterministic test cases for cross-language validation

5. **❌ Oversimplified Test Cases**
   - Previous tests used tiny matrices (2x2) instead of realistic sizes
   - Real D-LinOSS systems need 64+ oscillators for meaningful parallel scan
   - No performance benchmarking at scale

#### What IS Working:
- ✓ Basic binary operator mathematics (associativity)
- ✓ D-LinOSS IMEX discretization implementation
- ✓ Tensor operations on GPU device
- ✓ Numerical stability (no NaN/Inf values)

### `test_parallel_scan_1048.rs` - Original Parallel Scan Tests
**Status: Partially working but oversimplified**

Contains basic tests for:
- Binary operator associativity (but with small matrices)
- D-LinOSS IMEX stability
- GPU utilization (but with device conflicts)

**Issues:**
- Tests fail when run together due to GPU device conflicts
- Simplified test cases don't represent real-world usage
- No actual parallel scan implementation testing

### `test_dlinoss_core.rs` - Core Implementation Tests
**Status: Basic functionality verification**

Tests the core D-LinOSS mathematical operations:
- Basic tensor operations
- IMEX discretization
- Sequential state transitions

## Running Tests

Due to GPU device initialization conflicts, tests should be run individually:

```bash
# Run honest assessment (shows what's NOT working)
cargo test --test test_honest_1124

# Run individual parallel scan tests
cargo test --test test_parallel_scan_1048 test_module_works
cargo test --test test_parallel_scan_1048 test_binary_operator_associativity
cargo test --test test_parallel_scan_1048 test_dlinoss_imex_stability
cargo test --test test_parallel_scan_1048 test_gpu_utilization

# Run core tests
cargo test --test test_dlinoss_core
```

## Future Work Needed

1. **Implement True Parallel Scan**
   - Replace sequential loop with tree-based parallel reduction
   - Use binary_operator for associative parallel scan
   - Target O(log(seq_len)) complexity

2. **Fix GPU Device Management**
   - Implement proper device sharing between tests
   - Add GPU memory usage monitoring
   - Verify actual GPU computation (not just device placement)

3. **Add Python Reference Comparison**
   - Load reference results from damped-linoss repository
   - Implement numerical comparison with appropriate tolerance
   - Create deterministic test cases for cross-validation

4. **Scale Up Test Cases**
   - Test with realistic system sizes (64+ oscillators)
   - Add performance benchmarking
   - Compare sequential vs parallel implementation performance

5. **Mathematical Correctness Proofs**
   - Verify energy conservation properties
   - Test frequency response characteristics
   - Validate damping behavior against analytical solutions

## Compliance with .copilot Guidelines

This test suite follows the .copilot guidelines by:
- ✓ Honestly reporting what's NOT working
- ✓ Not oversimplifying code to get it running
- ✓ Using time-based markers (1124, 1048) instead of "better" naming
- ✓ Explicitly checking GPU usage (though verification is incomplete)
- ✓ Reporting issues more than claiming success

## Test Organization

Tests are organized as integration tests in the `tests/` directory rather than unit tests in `src/` modules, following Rust best practices for comprehensive system testing.
